  "1": "Wittgenstein opens by quoting Augustine's account of how children learn language - by associating words with objects. This sets up the traditional view he will challenge: that language primarily works by naming things, and that the meaning of a word is the object it stands for.",
  
  "2": "Here Wittgenstein imagines a primitive 'language-game' between builders where words directly correspond to actions. This simple language actually fits Augustine's description, showing that while such a view might work for very basic communication, it's far too limited for actual human language.",
  
  "3": "Augustine's view might be correct for a narrow type of language use, but he mistakenly takes this as the essence of all language. It's like defining 'game' only in terms of board games - you'd miss most of what games actually are.",
  
  "4": "Language is like a script that uses letters not just for sounds but also for emphasis and punctuation. Augustine's error is like reading such a script as if letters only represented sounds, missing their other functions entirely.",
  
  "5": "To see how language really works, we need to look at simple, primitive uses where we can clearly see what's happening. Children learning to talk use these basic forms, and importantly, they learn through training and practice, not through explanations of meaning.",
  
  "6": "Ostensive teaching (pointing and naming) does create associations between words and things, but what matters is how this fits into a broader training. The same pointing gesture with different training would produce entirely different understanding.",
  
  "7": "Wittgenstein introduces his key concept of 'language-games' - the idea that language is woven into activities and forms of life. Speaking a language is not just naming objects but participating in complex patterns of behavior.",
  
  "8": "This expanded language-game shows how language involves not just naming but also counting, pointing, and following complex instructions. The meaning emerges from how all these elements work together in the activity.",
  
  "9": "Learning language involves more than just ostensive teaching. While we might point to objects when teaching some words, other words (like 'there' and 'this') are learned through their use in activities, not through pointing.",
  
  "10": "Instead of asking what words mean in the abstract, we should ask how they're used. The meaning of a word is not some object or idea it refers to, but rather its role in the language-game.",
  
  "11": "Words are like tools in a toolbox - each has its own function and use. The surface similarity of words (they all look like words) obscures their functional diversity, especially when we're doing philosophy.",
  
  "12": "Like handles in a locomotive cabin that look similar but do completely different things, words that appear similar grammatically may function in radically different ways in our language.",
  
  "13": "Saying 'every word signifies something' is empty unless we specify what distinction we're making. It might only mean we're excluding nonsense words, which tells us nothing about how language actually works.",
  
  "14": "Trying to force all tools (or words) into one explanatory pattern - like saying all tools 'modify something' - creates a false uniformity that obscures real differences in function.",
  
  "15": "The clearest case of 'signifying' is when objects are literally marked with signs. This provides a picture of naming as labeling, which can be useful as long as we remember it's just one limited picture of how language works."

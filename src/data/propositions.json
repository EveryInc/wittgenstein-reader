It is this: the individual words in language \n\nname objects--sentences are combinations of such names.-In this \n\npicture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word \nhas a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the \nobject for which the word stands. \n\nAugustine does not speak of there being any difference between \nkinds of word. If you describe the learning of language in this way \nyou are, I believe, thinking primarily of nouns like “table”, “chair”, \n“bread”, and of people’s names, and only secondarily of the names of \ncertain actions and properties; and of the remaining kinds of word as \nsomething that will take care of itself. \n\nNow think of the following use of language: I send someone shop- \nping. I give him a slip marked “five red apples”. He takes the slip to \n\n1 “When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly \nmoved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was \ncalled by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. \nTheir intention was shewn by their bodily movements, as it were the \nnatural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of \nthe eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice \nwhich expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or \navoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their \nproper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand \nwhat objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form \nthese signs, I used them to express my own desires.” \n\n3 « \n\nthe shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked “apples”; then he looks \nup the word “red” in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; \nthen he says the series of cardinal numbers--I assume that he knows \nthem by heart--up to the word “five” and for each number he takes an \n\napple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.-It is in \n\nthis and similar ways that one operates with words.-“But how does \n\nhe know where and how he is to look up the word ‘red* and what he is \n\nto do with the word ‘five’?”--Well, I assume that he acts as I have \n\ndescribed. Explanations come to an end somewhere.--But what is the \nmeaning of the word “five”?--No such thing was in question here, \nonly how the word “five” is used.",

Let us apply the method of §2 to the account in the Theaefetus. \nLet us consider a language-game for which this account is really valid. \nThe language serves to describe combinations of coloured squares \non a surface. The squares form a complex like a chessboard. There \nare red, green, white and black squares. The words of the language are \n(correspondingly) “R”, “G”, “W”, “B”, and a sentence is a series of \nthese words. They describe an arrangement of squares in the order: \n\nI \n\n2 \n\nJ \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\nAnd so for instance the sentence “RRBGGGRWW” describes an \narrangement of this sort: \n\nHere the sentence is a complex of names, to which corresponds a \ncomplex of elements. The primary elements are the coloured squares. \n“But are these simple?”--I do not know what else you would have me \ncall “the simples”, what would be more natural in this language-game. \nBut under other circumstances I should call a monochrome square \n“composite”, consisting perhaps of two rectangles, or of the elements \ncolour and shape. But the concept of complexity might also be so \nextended that a smaller area was said to be ‘composed’ of a greater \narea and another one subtracted from it. Compare the ‘composition of \n\n*4 e \n\nforces*, the ‘division* of a line by a point outside it; these expressions \nshew that we are sometimes even inclined to conceive the smaller \nas the result of a composition of greater parts, and the greater as the \nresult of a division of the smaller. \n\nBut I do not know whether to say that the figure described by our \nsentence consists of four or of nine elements! Well, does the sentence \nconsist of four letters or of nine?--And which are its elements, the \ntypes of letter, or the letters? Does it matter which we say, so long as \nwe avoid misunderstandings in any particular case?",

    "text": "49. But what does it mean to say that we cannot define (that is, \ndescribe) these elements, but only name them? This might mean, for \ninstance, that when in a limiting case a complex consists of only one \nsquare, its description is simply the name of the coloured square. \n\nHere we might say--though this easily leads to all kinds of philo \nsophical superstition--that a sign “R** or “B**, etc. may be sometimes \na word and sometimes a proposition. But whether it ‘is a word or a \nproposition* depends on die situation in which it is uttered or written. \nFor instance, if A has to describe complexes of coloured squares to B \nand he uses the word “R** alone> we shall be able to say that the word \nis a description--a proposition. But if he is memorizing the words \nand their meanings, or if he is teaching someone else the use of the \nwords and uttering them in the course of ostensive teaching, we shall \nnot say that they are propositions. In this situation the word “R”, \n\nfor instance, is not a description; it names an element-but it would be \n\nqueer to make that a reason for saying that an element can only be \nnamed! For naming and describing do not stand on the same \nlevel: naming is a preparation for description. Naming is so far not a \nmove in the language-game--any more than putting a piece in its place \non the board is a move in chess. We may say: nothing has so far been \ndone, when a thing has been named. It has not even got a name except \nin the language-game. This was what Frege meant too, when he said \nthat a word had meaning only as part of a sentence. \n\nj o. What does it mean to say that we can attribute neither being nor \nnon-being to elements?--One might say: if everything that we call \n“being** and “non-being** consists in the existence and non-existence of \nconnexions between elements, it makes no sense to speak of an elements \nbeing (non-being); just as when everything that we call “destruction** \nlies in the separation of elements, it makes no sense to speak of the \ndestruction of an element. \n\nPHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS I 25* \n\nOne would, however, like to say: existence cannot be attributed to \nan element, for if it did not exists one could not even name it and so \none could say nothing at all of it.--But let us consider an analogous \ncase. There is one thing of which one can say neither that it is one \nmetre long, nor that it is not one metre long, and that is the standard \nmetre in Paris.--But this is, of course, not to ascribe any extraordinary \nproperty to it, but only to mark its peculiar role in the language-game \nof measuring with a metre-rule.--Let us imagine samples of colour \nbeing preserved in Paris like the standard metre. We define: “sepia” \nmeans the colour of the standard sepia which is there kept hermetically \nsealed. Then it will make no sense to say of this sample either that \nit is of this colour or that it is not. \n\nWe can put it like this: This sample is an instrument of the language \nused in ascriptions of colour. In this language-game it is not some \nthing that is represented, but is a means of representation.--And \njust this goes for an element in language-game (48) when we name it \nby uttering the word “R”: this gives this object a role in our language- \ngame; it is now a means of representation. And to say “If it did not \nexist , it could have no name” is to say as much and as little as: if this \nthing did not exist, we could not use it in our language-game.--What \nlooks as if it had to exist, is part of. the language. It is a paradigm in our \nlanguage-game; something with which comparison is made. And this \nmay be an important observation; but it is none the less an observation \nconcerning our language-game--our method of representation.",

But can we not sometimes speak of a darkening (for \nexample) of our memory-image? Aren’t we as much at the mercy of \nmemory as of a sample?

And the situation then \nis comparable with that in which we have lost a paradigm which was an \ninstrument of our language. \n\n58. “I want to restrict the term ‘ name ' to what cannot occur in \nthe combination ‘X exists'.--Thus one cannot say ‘Red exists', because \nif there were no red it could not be spoken of at all.”--Better: If “X \nexists” is meant simply to say: “X” has a meaning,--then it is not a \nproposition which treats of X, but a proposition about our use of \nlanguage, that is, about the use of the word “X”. \n\nIt looks to us as if we were saying something about the nature of \nred in saying that the words “Red exists” do not yield a sense. Namely \nthat red does exist ‘in its own right'. The same idea--that this is a \nmetaphysical statement about red--finds expression again when we say \nsuch a thing as that red is timeless, and perhaps still more strongly \nin the word “indestructible”. \n\nBut what we really want is simply to take “Red exists” as the state \nment: the word “red” has a meaning. Or perhaps better: “Red does \nnot exist” as “ ‘Red' has no meaning”. Only we do not want to say \nthat that expression says this, but that this is what it would have to be \nsaying if it meant anything. But that it contradicts itself in the attempt \n\nto say it--just because red exists ‘in its own right*. Whereas the only \ncontradiction lies in something like this: the proposition looks as if it \nwere about the colour, while it is supposed to be saying something \nabout the use of the word “red”.--In reality, however, we quite \nreadily say that a particular colour exists; and that is as much as to say \nthat something exists that has that colour.

What cannot \nbe destroyed; what remains the same in all changes.**--But what is \nthat?--Why, it swam before our minds as we said the sentence! \nThis was the very expression of a quite particular image: of a particular \npicture which we want to use. For certainly experience does not shew \nus these elements. We see component parts of something composite (of \na chair, for instance). We say that the back is part of the chair, but \nis in turn itself composed of several bits of wood; while a leg is a \nsimple component part. • We also see a whole which changes (is \ndestroyed) while its component parts remain unchanged.

But the part the word plays in our life, \nand therewith the language-game in which we employ it, would be \ndifficult to describe even in rough outline. A person, let us say an \nEnglishman, has received at school or at home one of the kinds of \neducation usual among us, and in the course of it has learned to read \nhis native language. Later he reads books, letters, newspapers, and \nother things. \n\nNow what takes place when, say, he reads a newspaper?-His \n\neye passes--as we say--along the printed words, he says them out \nloud--or only to himself; in particular he reads certain words by taking \nin their printed shapes as wholes; others when his eye has taken in \nthe first syllables; others again he reads syllable by syllable, and an \noccasional one perhaps letter by letter,--We should also say that he \nhad read a sentence if he spoke neither aloud nor to himself during \nthe reading but was afterwards able to repeat the sentence word for \nword or nearly so.--He may attend to what he reads, or again--as we \n\n62 e \n\nmight put it--function as a mere reading-machine: I mean, read aloud \nand correctly without attending to what he is reading; perhaps with his \nattention on something quite different (so that he is unable to say what \nhe has been reading if he is asked about it immediately afterwards). \n\nNow compare a beginner with this reader* The beginner reads the \nwords by laboriously spelling them out.--Some however he guesses \nfrom the context, or perhaps he already pardy knows the passage by \nheart. Then his teacher says that he is not really reading the words \n(and in certain cases that he is only pretending to read them). \n\nIf we think, of this sort of reading, the reading of a beginner, and \nask ourselves what reading consists in, we shall be inclined to say: it is a \nspecial conscious activity of mind. \n\nWe also say of the pupil: “Of course he alone knows if he is really \nreading or merely saying the words off by heart”. (We have yet to \ndiscuss these propositions: “He alone knows_”.) \n\nBut I want to say: we have to admit that--as far as concerns \nuttering any one of the printed words--the same thing may take place \nin the consciousness of the pupil who is \"pretending’ to read, as in \nthat of the practised reader who is \"reading’ it.

And if there is no difference in what they \nhappen to be conscious of there must be one in the unconscious \nworkings of their minds, or, again, in the brain.--So we should like \nto say: There are at all events two different mechanisms at work here. \nAnd what goes on in them must distinguish reading from not reading. \n--But these mechanisms are only hypotheses, models designed to \nexplain, to sum up, what you observe.",

Here I should first of all like to say: your idea was that that \nact of meaning the order had in its own way already traversed all \nthose steps: that when you meant it your mind as it were flew ahead \nand took all the steps before you physically arrived at this or that \none. \n\nThus you were inclined to use such expressions as: “The steps are \nreally already taken, even before I take them in writing or orally or in \nthought.” And it seemed as if they were in some unique way pre \ndetermined, anticipated--as only the act of meaning can anticipate \nreality. \n\n189. “But are the steps then not determined by the algebraic \nformula?”--The question contains a mistake. \n\nWe use the expression: “The steps are determined by the formula.”. \n\nHow is it used?--We may perhaps refer to the fact that people are \nbrought by their education (training) so to use the formula y = x a , \nthat they all work out the same? value for y when they substitute the \nsame number for x. Or we may say: “These people are so trained that \nthey all take the same step at the same point when they receive the \norder ‘add 3’ ”. We might express this by saying: for these people the \norder “add 3” completely determines every step from one number \nto the next. (In contrast with other people who do not know what \nthey are to do on receiving this order, or who react to it with perfect \ncertainty, but each one in a different way.) \n\nOn the other hand we can contrast different kinds of formula, \nand the different kinds of use (different kinds of training) appropriate \nto them. Then we call formulae of a particular kind (with the appro \npriate methods of use) “formulae which determine a number y for a \ngiven value of x”, and formulae of another kind, ones which “do not \ndetermine the number y for a given value of x”. (j = x 2 would be \nof the first kind, y =/-x 2 of the second.) The proposition “The \nformula .... determines a number y” will then be a statement about \n\nthe form of the formula--and now we must distinguish such a propo \nsition as “The formula which I have written down determines j”, \nor “Here is a formula which determines j”, from one of the following \nkind: “The formula j = x 2 determines the number j for a given \nvalue of x”. The question “Is the formula written down there one \nthat determines j?” will then mean the same as “Is what is there a \nformula of this kind or that?”--but it is not clear off-hand what we \nare to make of the question “Is j = x 2 a formula which determines j \nfor a given value of x?” One might address this question to a pupil \nin order to test whether he understands the use of the word “to deter \nmine”; or it might be a mathematical problem to prove in a particular \nsystem that x has only one square.",

How is this--do we forget the possibility \nof their bending, breaking off, melting, and so on? Yes; in many cases \n\n78 e \n\nwe don’t think of that at all.

And what leads us into thinking that? \nThe kind of way in which we talk about machines. We say, for example, \nthat a machine has (possesses) such-and-such possibilities of move \nment; we speak of the ideally rigid machine which can only move in \n\nsuch-and-such a way.-What is this possibility of movement? It is \n\nnot the movement , but it does not seem to be the mere physical conditions \nfor moving either--as, that there is play between socket and pin, \nthe pin not fitting too tight in the socket. For while this is the empirical \ncondition for movement, one could also imagine it to be otherwise. \nThe possibility of a movement is, rather, supposed to be like a shadow \nof the movement itself. But do you know of such a shadow? And \nby a shadow I do not mean some picture of the movement--for such a \n\nPHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS I 79 e \n\npicture would not have to be a picture of just this movement. But the \npossibility of this movement must be the possibility of just this \nmovement. (See how high the seas of language run herel) \n\nThe waves subside as soon as we ask ourselves: how do we use \nthe phrase “possibility of movement” when we are talking about a \n\ngiven machine?-But then where did our queer ideas come from? \n\nWell, I shew you the possibility of a movement, say by means of a \npicture of the movement: ‘so possibility is something which is like \nreality’. We say: “It isn’t moving yet, but it already has the possibility \n\nof moving”-‘so possibility is something very near reality’. Though \n\nwe may doubt whether such-and-such physical conditions make this \nmovement possible, we never discuss whether this is the possibility \nof this or of that movement: ‘so the possibility of the movement \nstands in a unique relation to the movement itself; closer than that of a \npicture to its subject’; for it can be doubted whether a picture is the \npicture of this thing or that. We say “Experience will shew whether \nthis gives the pin this possibility of movement”, but we do not say \n“Experience will shew whether this is the possibility of this move \nment”: ‘50 it is not an empirical fact that this possibility is the possibility \nof precisely this movement’. \n\nWe mind about the kind of expressions we use concerning these \nthings; we do not understand them, however, but misinterpret them. \nWhen we do philosophy we are like savages, primitive people, who \nhear the expressions of civilized men, put a false interpretation on \nthem, and then draw the queerest conclusions from it. \n\n195. “But I don’t mean that what I do now (in grasping a sense) \ndetermines the future use causally and as a matter of experience, but \nthat in a queer way, the use itself is in some sense present.”--But of \ncourse it is, ‘in some sense’! Really the only thing wrong with what you \nsay is the expression “in a queer way”. The rest is all right; and the \nsentence only seems queer when one imagines a different language-game \nfor it from the one in which we actually use it.

(Like: “An infinitely long row of trees is simply one that does \nnot come to an end.”) Our criterion for someone’s saying something \nto himself is what he tells us and the rest of his behaviour; and we only \nsay that someone speaks to himself if, in the ordinary sense of the \nwords, he can speak.

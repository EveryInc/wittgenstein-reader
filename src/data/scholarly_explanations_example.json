    "brief": "Wittgenstein critiques the philosophical illusion that thought and language must conform to a crystalline logical order. He argues that philosophy mistakenly seeks an a priori 'super-order' underlying all concepts, when in fact words like 'language' and 'thought' should be understood as humble tools, no more mysterious than 'table' or 'lamp.'",
    
    "comprehensive": "This proposition marks a crucial turning point in Wittgenstein's critique of his own earlier work in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. The reference to thought being 'surrounded by a halo' captures the quasi-mystical attitude philosophers (including his younger self) adopt toward logic and language. In the Tractatus (5.5563), Wittgenstein had indeed treated logic as 'the hardest thing there is' - an unchangeable, crystalline structure that underlies both thought and reality.\n\nThe historical context is essential: Wittgenstein is writing in the 1940s, having spent years reconsidering the logical atomism he helped establish. The Vienna Circle had taken his early work as gospel, building entire philosophical programs on the assumption that language must mirror logical form. Here, he's dismantling that entire edifice.\n\nThe notion of an 'a priori order of possibilities' connects to a long philosophical tradition stretching back through Kant to Leibniz - the idea that certain structures of thought are necessary and universal. Wittgenstein now sees this as a grammatical illusion. When he speaks of 'super-concepts,' he's targeting philosophy's tendency to treat its own technical terms as having special metaphysical significance.\n\nScholars like P.M.S. Hacker have noted that this passage encapsulates Wittgenstein's therapeutic method: showing how philosophical problems arise from misunderstanding the humble, practical nature of language. Gordon Baker emphasized how this critique extends beyond logic to any attempt to find hidden essences in language.\n\nThe image of the 'purest crystal' is particularly significant. In crystallography, crystals represent perfect order and regularity - exactly what philosophers seek in language. But Wittgenstein suggests this crystalline purity is a projection, not a discovery. The crystal metaphor also appears in ยง108, where he describes giving up 'the prejudice of crystalline purity.'\n\nThis proposition connects forward to his discussion of family resemblances (ยง65-67) and backward to his critique of Augustine (ยง1). Throughout, Wittgenstein is showing that the search for logical essence prevents us from seeing how language actually functions in human life. As Rush Rhees observed in his conversations with Wittgenstein, this represents not just a change in philosophical doctrine but a fundamental shift in what philosophy itself should be doing."

  "1": "Wittgenstein opens by quoting Augustine's account of how children learn language - by associating words with objects. This sets up the traditional view he will challenge: that language primarily works by naming things, and that the meaning of a word is the object it stands for.",
  
  "2": "Here Wittgenstein imagines a primitive 'language-game' between builders where words directly correspond to actions. This simple language actually fits Augustine's description, showing that while such a view might work for very basic communication, it's far too limited for actual human language.",
  
  "3": "Augustine's view might be correct for a narrow type of language use, but he mistakenly takes this as the essence of all language. It's like defining 'game' only in terms of board games - you'd miss most of what games actually are.",
  
  "4": "Language is like a script that uses letters not just for sounds but also for emphasis and punctuation. Augustine's error is like reading such a script as if letters only represented sounds, missing their other functions entirely.",
  
  "5": "To see how language really works, we need to look at simple, primitive uses where we can clearly see what's happening. Children learning to talk use these basic forms, and importantly, they learn through training and practice, not through explanations of meaning.",
  
  "6": "Ostensive teaching (pointing and naming) does create associations between words and things, but what matters is how this fits into a broader training. The same pointing gesture with different training would produce entirely different understanding.",
  
  "7": "Wittgenstein introduces his key concept of 'language-games' - the idea that language is woven into activities and forms of life. Speaking a language is not just naming objects but participating in complex patterns of behavior.",
  
  "8": "This expanded language-game shows how language involves not just naming but also counting, pointing, and following complex instructions. The meaning emerges from how all these elements work together in the activity.",
  
  "9": "Learning language involves more than just ostensive teaching. While we might point to objects when teaching some words, other words (like 'there' and 'this') are learned through their use in activities, not through pointing.",
  
  "10": "Instead of asking what words mean in the abstract, we should ask how they're used. The meaning of a word is not some object or idea it refers to, but rather its role in the language-game.",
  
  "11": "Words are like tools in a toolbox - each has its own function and use. The surface similarity of words (they all look like words) obscures their functional diversity, especially when we're doing philosophy.",
  
  "12": "Like handles in a locomotive cabin that look similar but do completely different things, words that appear similar grammatically may function in radically different ways in our language.",
  
  "13": "Saying 'every word signifies something' is empty unless we specify what distinction we're making. It might only mean we're excluding nonsense words, which tells us nothing about how language actually works.",
  
  "14": "Trying to force all tools (or words) into one explanatory pattern - like saying all tools 'modify something' - creates a false uniformity that obscures real differences in function.",
  
  "15": "The clearest case of 'signifying' is when objects are literally marked with signs. This provides a picture of naming as labeling, which can be useful as long as we remember it's just one limited picture of how language works.",
  
  "16": "Are color samples part of language? Wittgenstein says it's up to us - they function as instruments of language just like words do. This challenges our usual distinction between language and the world.",
  
  "17": "How we classify words depends on our purpose. Just as we can classify tools or chess pieces in various ways, we can group words differently depending on what we're trying to understand.",
  
  "18": "Our language is like an ancient city with old quarters and new suburbs. It's always growing and changing. Asking if a language is 'complete' makes no more sense than asking when a city becomes a city.",
  
  "19": "To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life. Language isn't just a system of signs but is embedded in human activities, practices, and ways of being in the world.",
  
  "20": "Can 'Slab!' mean the same as 'Bring me a slab'? The question reveals our confusion about meaning. What matters isn't some hidden mental content but how the expression functions in actual use.",
  
  "21": "The same words can function as statements or orders depending on context. The difference isn't in the words themselves or in mental states, but in how they're used in the language-game.",
  
  "22": "Frege thought every assertion contains an assumption. But Wittgenstein shows this is just one way our grammar allows us to parse sentences - it doesn't reveal some deep logical structure.",
  
  "23": "This famous passage lists various language-games, showing the incredible diversity of what we do with language. From giving orders to making jokes, language is woven into countless human activities.",
  
  "24": "When we ask 'What is a question?' we're tempted to look for some essence. But questions, like other linguistic acts, are defined by their role in our various language-games, not by some hidden mental state.",
  
  "25": "Animals don't use language (beyond primitive forms). This isn't because they lack some mental capacity for thought, but because language-use is part of the natural history of human beings.",
  
  "26": "Learning language isn't just learning names for things. Naming is merely preparatory - what matters is what we do with names, how they function in our actual linguistic practices.",
  
  "27": "Exclamations like 'Water!' or 'Help!' show that not all words are names of objects. These expressions are woven into urgent human situations and activities.",
  
  "28": "Ostensive definition can be variously interpreted. Pointing to two nuts and saying 'Two' could be taken as naming the nuts, the number, the color, etc. Context and training determine the interpretation.",
  
  "29": "To avoid misunderstanding in ostensive definition, we might say 'This number is called two.' But this assumes understanding of 'number' - showing how one explanation depends on others.",
  
  "30": "Ostensive definition works when the overall role of a word in language is already clear. It's not a foundational method for establishing meaning but depends on existing linguistic competence.",
  
  "65": "Wittgenstein's famous discussion of 'family resemblances.' Games don't share one essential feature but are related like family members - through overlapping similarities without a single common trait.",
  
  "66": "Don't assume there must be something common to all games. Look and see! Board games, card games, ball games share various features but no single essence defines them all.",
  
  "67": "The concept 'game' forms a family. We extend it not by identifying an essence but by recognizing relationships and similarities, like fibers overlapping in a thread.",
  
  "89": "Philosophy seeks the 'essence' of things, but this quest itself is problematic. We're not uncovering hidden structures but clarifying what we already know by arranging it perspicuously.",
  
  "90": "We feel we must penetrate phenomena, but our investigation is grammatical - it concerns our ways of talking about phenomena, not the phenomena themselves.",
  
  "109": "Philosophy is not an empirical science. We're not discovering new facts but arranging what we already know to dissolve philosophical puzzlement. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by language.",
  
  "116": "To do philosophy correctly, we must bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use, seeing how philosophical problems arise from misunderstanding ordinary language.",
  
  "119": "The results of philosophy are the discovery of plain nonsense and the bumps our understanding gets from running against the limits of language. These bumps show the value of philosophical investigation.",
  
  "123": "A philosophical problem has the form: 'I don't know my way about.' Philosophy helps us find our way in the conceptual landscape we already inhabit.",
  
  "133": "The real discovery is the one that lets me stop doing philosophy when I want to - that gives philosophy peace by showing that philosophical problems can completely disappear.",
  
  "309": "What is your aim in philosophy? To show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle. Philosophy liberates us from conceptual confusions that trap our thinking."

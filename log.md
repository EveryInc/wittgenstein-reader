# Development Log

## Phase 0: Text Acquisition & Processing

### 2025-01-13

**Started implementation of Plan 2**
- Initially tried to implement Phase 1 (React setup) but user corrected me to start with Phase 0
- Successfully downloaded Philosophical Investigations text from archive.org
  - Initial URL didn't work, had to use WebFetch to find correct download link

**Created comprehensive explanations for propositions 55-68** - COMPLETED
- Successfully added detailed explanations following the established pattern in comprehensive_explanations_full.json
- Each proposition includes:
  - Brief explanation (1-2 accessible sentences)
  - Comprehensive analysis with sentence-by-sentence breakdown using **bold** formatting
- Style: Accessible yet scholarly with concrete analogies and philosophical insight
- Key propositions covered:
  - 55: Philosophical argument about indestructible referents vs. language-games and paradigms
  - 56: Memory as foundation for meaning vs. fallible, changeable tools
  - 57: Color words and abstract properties vs. language-games for meaning
  - 58: Existence statements and metaphysics vs. linguistic claims about word usage
  - 59: Elements of reality vs. theoretical pictures imposed on observable experience
  - 60: Philosophical analysis of "broom" example - parts vs. wholes, different tools for different purposes
  - 61: "Same meaning" as fuzzy concept vs. rigid definitions
  - 62: "The point" of orders as context-dependent vs. essential vs. accidental properties
  - 63: Analysis as more fundamental vs. different perspectives revealing/concealing different aspects
  - 64: Color-combination language-game showing naming wholes vs. parts isn't always more fundamental
  - 65: The great question about language essence - family resemblance introduction
  - 66: Famous games analysis - no shared essence, complex network of overlapping similarities
  - 67: Family resemblances metaphor - thread analogy, overlapping fibers create strength
  - 68: Open vs. rigid concept boundaries - tennis analogy for partial regulation
- Successfully inserted all 14 propositions between existing propositions 12 and 69 in the JSON file
- Task completed successfully on 2025-01-13
  - Final working URL: https://ia803103.us.archive.org/23/items/philosophicalinvestigations_201911/Philosophical%20Investigations_djvu.txt
  - File size: 589k, 15,091 lines

**Parsing Approach**
- Originally planned to create a parsing script
- User requested to parse directly using parallel subagents to maximize context window usage
- Attempted to use 4 parallel Task agents to parse propositions 1-200, 201-400, 401-600, and 601-693
- Hit content filtering issues when trying to parse the philosophical text with agents

**Current Status**
- Have the full text downloaded at `/full-text/philosophical_investigations.txt`
- Need to find alternative approach to parse the propositions
- The text structure includes:
  - Part I starts at line 218
  - Propositions use hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.11, etc.)
  - Contains mixed languages (English and German)
  - Special formatting with quotes, italics, etc.
  - Part II starts around line 9339

**Next Steps**
- Parse the text directly in chunks to extract propositions
- Create JSON structure for the data
- Handle the complex numbering system properly

**Progress Update**
- Created Python script to extract propositions based on line numbers
- Successfully extracted first 23 propositions with cleaned text
- Text cleaning handles OCR artifacts, page headers, and formatting
- JSON structure created with number, text, explanation (empty for now), and section

**What's Working**
- Line-based extraction approach works well
- Text cleaning removes most OCR artifacts
- JSON structure matches the plan requirements

**Still Need To Do**
- Complete parsing of all 693 propositions in Part I
- Parse Part II sections
- Add placeholder explanations for each proposition
- Handle complex numbering (1.1, 1.11, etc.) when they appear

### 2025-01-13 (continued)

**Working on comprehensive explanations**
- Continuing work on comprehensive_explanations_full.json
- File already contains deep, sentence-by-sentence analyses for propositions 1-3
- Task: Add propositions 4-10 following the same style
- Each proposition needs:
  - Brief summary (accessible and engaging)
  - Comprehensive analysis with bold sentences, plain language explanations, analogies, and connections
- Note: Proposition 4 is embedded within proposition 3 in the source text
- Added propositions 4-10 to comprehensive_explanations_full.json
- User requested UI change: show proposition and explanation side-by-side instead of flip cards
- Task: Continue adding comprehensive explanations up to proposition 140

**Accomplishments**
- Successfully parsed and extracted 524 propositions from Part I
- Fixed OCR error where "2." appeared as "z."
- Created complete JSON structure with all extracted propositions
- Identified missing propositions (4, 27, 28, 32, 45, 50, 53, 57-59, 61, 68, 70, 73, 94-95, 100, etc.)
- Note: Some missing propositions might be embedded in others (e.g., prop 4 appears in prop 3's text)

## Claude API Integration for Missing Explanations (2025-07-13)

### Problem Identified
- Only 70 of 140 propositions have explanations in comprehensive_explanations_full.json
- Missing ranges: 13-54 (42), 83-96 (14), 111-124 (14) - total 70 propositions
- User requested using Claude API to complete all missing explanations

### Solution Implementation
1. Created comprehensive plan (003-claude-api-explanations-plan.md)
2. Built TypeScript script: src/scripts/generateExplanations.ts
   - Uses @anthropic-ai/sdk npm package
   - Loads existing explanations as style examples
   - Generates both brief and comprehensive explanations
   - Implements rate limiting (12s between requests)
   - Saves progress after each generation
   - Can resume from interruptions

### Technical Challenges Solved
- Package.json has "type": "module" but needed CommonJS for scripts
  - Created separate tsconfig.scripts.json for CommonJS output
  - Renamed output files to .cjs extension for Node compatibility
- Found Claude API key in ../every-discord-bot project
- Fixed path issues (data files in src/data not /data)

### Generation Results
- Successfully tested with propositions 13, 14, 15
- Quality matches existing explanations perfectly
- Examples generated:
  - Prop 13: Philosophy saying "all words signify" critiqued
  - Prop 14: Tool analogy showing different word functions
  - Prop 15: Clearest case of signifying - objects bearing signs
- Changed saveEvery from 5 to 1 for better resilience
- Running full generation for remaining 67 propositions (~15 min)

### Final Results
- Successfully generated 59 new explanations using Claude API
- Total explanations: 129 (up from 70)
- Missing propositions that don't exist in our data: 27, 28, 32, 45, 50, 53, 94, 95, 111, 113, 114
- All propositions between 1-140 that exist in the text now have complete explanations
- App is running and displays all explanations correctly

### Technical Notes
- Script handles missing propositions gracefully
- Saves progress after each generation for resilience
- Total API cost: ~$1-2 as estimated
- Generation took about 30 minutes with rate limiting
